## 🤓 About Me

🌍 I'm a native Spanish speaker from 🇨🇱 Chile with strong communication skills in English, making me comfortable in bilingual environments. My English proficiency allows me to engage effectively in both technical and professional contexts, ensuring clear and impactful communication.

💻 Currently, I work in the [Computer Science Department](https://dcc.uchile.cl/nosotros/equipo/) of the [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/) as the Head of the Software Development Area, where I lead the development of critical systems for the university. I am also a professor in the [Software Engineering Postgraduate Diploma](https://dcc.uchile.cl/educacion-continua/diplomas/ingenieria-software) program, teaching the [Software Workshop](https://dcc.uchile.cl/educacion-continua/curso/CC73B/11030338) course. This hands-on workshop allows students to apply the knowledge acquired throughout the diploma by working on a comprehensive, fictitious case study.

👨‍💻 As a **Software Engineer**, I bring over a decade of experience across technical roles, project management, and team leadership in information technology. My approach is to design and develop scalable, secure, and efficient systems while adhering to best practices throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). I am driven to ensure that the solutions I build are reliable, adaptable, and geared for long-term growth, consistently delivering high-quality results.

🔐 With a strong focus on **Secure Software Development**, I am dedicated to implementing secure coding practices that guard applications against vulnerabilities, following OWASP and other industry standards. This commitment ensures that the software I develop is both functional and resilient against a range of security threats.

💾 My coding journey spans diverse technologies. From web development with Django, Flask, and FastAPI, to Artificial Intelligence with PyTorch and Tensorflow, I've built a well-rounded skill set. While 🐍 **Python** is my primary language, I have solid experience in 🧩 C++, ☕ Java, 🐘 PHP, and 🌐 JavaScript, each adding valuable layers to my coding expertise (yes, I fully embrace every language, quirks and semicolons included! 😎).

🎯 I'm a proactive and committed professional with solid ethical principles. I continuously work to refine my technical, management, and leadership skills, staying up-to-date in an ever-evolving field. My adaptability and empathy are among my key strengths, helping me foster trust and collaboration within teams.

🚀 I thrive in challenging and dynamic environments where motivation and teamwork are essential. I value both personal and professional development, seeking out opportunities that allow growth in both areas. Alongside my technical expertise, I have a natural ability to learn and share knowledge, creating an environment of mutual growth and excellence.

📚 Since 2021, I've also been more involved in academia, a path that I plan to deepen by starting research in Software Engineering in 2025. I look forward to contributing to the academic field, exploring research that aligns with my interests and professional experience.
